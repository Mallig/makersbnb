# makersbnb

This application allows signed-up users to:

- List a new space.
- List multiple spaces.
 - Name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.
- Offer a range of dates where their space is available.
- Hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.
 - Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space.
 - Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.
